			<div class="contentBottom">
				<p>
					I cant quite remember the first time I used a computer but the first computer related memory i have was trying to play a
					game that was pretty resource intensive and finding out that not all computers are the exact same and that some are better
					than others, and of course the better ones are more expensive.

					the first computer I bought with my own money was a custom built gaming PC that I spent about 700 dollars on, and the first
